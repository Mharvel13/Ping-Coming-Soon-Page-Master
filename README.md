## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Submit their email address using an `input` field
-   Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    -   The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
    -   The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

#### Form Validation

I implemented form validation on the form to ensure that valid data is passed to the form and the imput feilds are not left blank. i also ensured that the correct format for the inputs were entered, especially for the email and name field.
The validation Functionlity is done based on a a single function that can be resued with any form field to ensure code refactoring.

#### DOM Manipulation

Working with the DOM was also learned and practised under the form validation as a means to display error messages and symbols
